Scrooge is a high-performance pairwise sequence aligner based on the GenASM algorithm. Scrooge includes three novel algorithmic improvements on top of GenASM, and high-performance CPU and GPU implementations. Described by Lindegger et al. at https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15561

The Scrooge source code and evaluation scripts will soon be available in this repository.
